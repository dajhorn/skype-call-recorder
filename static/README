when you build statically, this directory is supposed to contain
the static versions of libid3 and libmp3lame.  subdirs lib/ and
include/ are expected.  use "utils/cmake-static ." to compile a
static version

follow these instructions to build the static libraries.  this
assumes $BASE points to the base source directory

instructions for building static libid3:
	# Unpack id3lib-x.x.x.tar.gz
	./configure --enable-static --disable-shared --prefix=$BASE/static
	( cd src && make install-strip )
	( cd include && make install )

instructions for building static libmp3lame:
	# unpack lame-x.xx.tar.gz
	./configure --enable-static --disable-shared --prefix=$BASE/static
	( cd mpglib && make )
	( cd libmp3lame && make install-strip )
	( cd include && make install )
